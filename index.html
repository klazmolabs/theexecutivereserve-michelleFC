            <p>This service is delivered within a fully self-contained mobile styling station designed for corporate settings.
                Hair is lightly misted to allow for controlled execution prior to a tailored men's cut is performed using high-performance
                cutting tools. Before completion, the edges are precisely refined through meticulous perimeter detailing, and the neck is thoroughly
                cleaned and finished with a cooling astringent. Hair is then proffesionally dried and styled with premium products. Any hair in contact 
                with the skin is lightly dusted away to prevent irritation, and all debris is fully vaccumned and cleared-leaving a clean, polished finish with 
                 true salon level results.

            <h3>Michelle Ferreira Calisto</h3>
            <h4>Founder, The Executive Reserve</h4>
            <p>
                With over two decades of experience in New York's leading salons, including Pierre Michel Salon and Davide Torchie Salon, I'm known for clean, modern cuts
                and a meticulous, detail-driven approach. My work is rooted in a family lineage of Portuguese barbers dating back to the 1920s. I operate privately and do not advertise,
                building long-standing client relationships through trust and discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Executive Reserve was created after years of serving clientele with demanding schedules and limited time. I saw a need for hair services integrated directly into the workday,
                eliminating travel and saving time. This evolved into on-site program designed for individuals who value efficiency, consistency, and a high standard of personal presentation.
